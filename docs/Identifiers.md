# Identifiers
The identifier system in BridgeNet2 uses shortened strings to represent constant, static strings and save on bandwidth. The library provides functions to easily create and read identifiers in your code, improving the efficiency of your game by reducing the amount of data transmitted over the network.

# Using identifiers
BridgeNet2 provides functionality to create identifiers without interference in your code. `ReferenceIdentifier`, `FromCompressed` and `FromIdentifier` are utility functions to create and read identifiers.
